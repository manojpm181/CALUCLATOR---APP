# CALUCLATOR---APP

Something that people used to have lots of headaches over in the past, can now be created in a couple of hours, with the use of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Grateful to be friends with Javascript! :) With a little bit of help from the great internet, I had no problem figuring out the order in which a calculator is created, and it was actually easier and faster than I had imagined.
